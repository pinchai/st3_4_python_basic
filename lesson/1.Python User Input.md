# Python User Input

Python allows for user input.
That means we are able to ask the user for input.
The method is a bit different in Python 3.6 than Python 2.7.
 - Python 3.6 uses the input() method.
 - Python 2.7 uses the raw_input() method.

````
#Python 3.0
username = input("Enter username:")
print("Username is: " + username)
````


````
#Python 2.0
username = raw_input("Enter username:")
print("Username is: " + username)
````
