###Tuple
Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.
Tuples are written with round brackets.

````
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(thistuple[1])
````

###Change Tuple Values
````
x = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
y = list(x)
y[1] = "kiwi"
x = tuple(y)

print(x)
````

###Loop Through a Tuple
````
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
for x in thistuple:
  print(x)
````
