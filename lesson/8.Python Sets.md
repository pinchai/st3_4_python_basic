###Sets
Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Tuple, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.

for x in thisset:
  print(x)
````

print(thisset)
````

###Remove Item

thisset.remove("banana")
print(thisset)
````
