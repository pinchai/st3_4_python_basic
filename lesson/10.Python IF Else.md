###Introduction
Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

Equals: a == b
Not Equals: a != b
Less than: a < b
Less than or equal to: a <= b
Greater than: a > b
Greater than or equal to: a >= b
These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.

An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.
_Example:_


###if
````
a = 33
b = 200
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
````

###Elif
````
a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")
else:
  print("a is greater than b")
````

###Short Hand If ... Else
````
a = 2
b = 330
print("A") if a > b else print("B")
````
